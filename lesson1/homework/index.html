        <h1>Minecraft</h1>
        <p>I like the blocks in <b>Minecraft.</b></p>
        <p>One of those blocks is <i>tnt.</i> I like it because it explodes almost everything!</p>
        <p>I also like <u>lava</u> because it will light everything on fire.</p>
        <p><b><I>Redstone</I></b> is another great block. I once went to the library and got a book on redstone and made a cool armor switcher.</p>
